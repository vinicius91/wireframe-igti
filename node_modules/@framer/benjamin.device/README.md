# Overview
A device component that allows you to view your work in a clay-like, soft device frame, from mobile to tablet. Shadows automatically blend in the background, it includes a light and a dark frame, and everything from the sizing to the radius is completely customizable. By default, it mimics an iPhone X device, but you can preview your work in any generic iOS or Android form. You can even animate the device Frames!
