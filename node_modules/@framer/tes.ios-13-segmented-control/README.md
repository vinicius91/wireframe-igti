## Overview

A bit of skeuomorphism returned to iPhone’s default UI with the new look of the [Segmented Control](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/ios/controls/segmented-controls/) in iOS 13.

This Framer X version is made to work with Overrides: It will share its currently selected segment through a callback property.

➡️ How to build this component is [explained step-by-step](https://framerbook.com/x/smart-components/ios-segmented-control/) in The Framer book

## Properties

| Property | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Mode | `boolean` | Light or Dark mode |
| Options | `string[]` | Names of the (max. 5) segments |
| Set Current by | `boolean ` | Set the selected segment by index or name |
| Current Index | `number` | Index of the selected segment |
| Current Option | `string` | Name of the selected segment |
| Callback property | `function` | Event callback property that shares the selected segment |

### Mode

* Name: `mode`
* Default value: `true` (= Light Mode)

You can switch between Light Mode and the new [Dark Mode](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/ios/visual-design/dark-mode/).

Note: The background of the component is always the same color, a transparent gray of which opacity changes (just a bit) when switching between light and dark mode. (I used the segmented control in Apple’s [iOS Sketch template](https://developer.apple.com/design/resources/) as a color reference.)

### Options

* Name: `options`
* Default value: `["Cherry", "Kiwi", "Banana", "Mango", "Lemon"]`

An array of strings with the names of the (max. 5) segments.

### Properties for the currently selected segment

You can set the selected segment by either index number **or** by name.

#### Set Current by

* Name: `setCurrentBy`
* Default value: `true` (select by index)

This property defines whether the value of ‘Current Index’ or ‘Current Option’ will be used to set the selected segment. (The ‘Set current’ property control will show only one of them and [hide](https://www.framer.com/api/property-controls/#hiding-controls) the other.)

#### Current Index

* Name: `currentIndex`
* Default value: `0` (first segment)

Sets the selected segment by its index number (between `0` and `4`).

#### Current Option

* Name: `currentOption`
* Default value: `"Kiwi"` (second segment)

Sets the selected segment by its option name.
  
### Callback property

* Name: `onValueChange(option, index)`
* Default value: `null`

The callback property will share both the `option` (as a `string`) and the `index` (as a `number`) of the selected segment.

### Override examples using the callback property

How to get the currently selected option:

```javascript
import { Override, Data } from "framer"

const appState = Data({
    currentOption: null,
})

export function SegmentedControl(): Override {
    return {
        onValueChange(option, index) {
            appState.currentOption = option
        },
    }
}

export function CurrentOption(): Override {
    return {
        text: appState.currentOption,
    }
}
```

How to get the currently selected index:

```jsx
import { Override, Data } from "framer"

const appState = Data({
    currentIndex: null,
})

export function SegmentedControl(): Override {
    return {
        onValueChange(option, index) {
            appState.currentIndex = index
        },
    }
}

export function CurrentIndex(): Override {
    return {
        text: appState.currentIndex,
    }
}
```

## Example prototypes

I recreated a few iOS screens that use this UI element:
* The Steps screen in the iPhone Health app
* Changing the Maps Settings in Apple’s Maps app
